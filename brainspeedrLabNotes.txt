Some comments by Becki:
#how familiar BEFORE reading?
#Which text did you enjoy/like most ?
#Which of these words appeared in the text? => make clear there can be multiple
#How comfortable did you feel, when speed reading this text? => weird => fix it

to do list:

- compute scores
- compute perception
- remove eye-blink online (find a simple method)


Paper:

Introduction:
- Neurofeedback
- RVSP 
- control RVSP as a form of feedback

Hypotheses:
1. control or not control rate
2. why control (in relation with word length)? => cf paper on time to read words (logarithm)
3. how control (in relation with EEG signal from Entropy to power spectrum)?


Method:
- design
- treatments

Results:
- those who control, and the others
- modulation of entropy in the vicinity of large word: sometimes before, sometimes after
- modulation of entropy regarding treatment bsrPlus,bsrMinus
- effects on / implications for comprehension (to do) :
	+ across treatments



privacy paper:
- conditional probability of word length given entropy
- how many users reading the same text are required to re-identify (there may be a tradeoff between this and the next question => you can re-identify shorter texts if you know that more people read this text).
- how much of the text is necessary to re-identify (how certainty grows accordingly)? => here we can make a simple assessment / argument of how hard it becomes to discriminate a text as the corpus gets larger. (i.e. measuring unicity as a function of length => the longer the vector, the more likely the ordered combination of word lengths becomes unique.)
- capacity to discriminate a text from another is related to its unicity (cosim measure of word lengths until n should be fine)
- re-identification of user with entropy?

- hamming theory / distance => coding theory

do -1,0,1 instead of continuous
show on the graph where the small and larger words
heuristic search on the entropy / choice of the running window to see whether it improves the joint pdf
